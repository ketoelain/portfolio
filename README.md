## Projects

### Project 1: ENVISION

#### Description: 
Project ENVISION aimed to transform the existing digital anesthesia documentation tool, Sandman.MD, into an intelligent decision-support system called Sandman. IC. This system was tailored for monitoring, predicting, and treating COVID-19 patients in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). It involved a collaboration between a multidisciplinary public-private consortium and was validated in 13 hospitals across Europe. 
 
**Key Responsibilities**: 
- Coordinated the development of Sandman.IC to meet the requirements of medical partners. 
- Collaborated closely with the private sector partner for app development and AI experts for system integration. 
- Managed data collection efforts across clinical partners. 
- Processed, combined, and anonymized heterogeneous datasets from multiple hospitals. 
- Harmonized collected data for training machine learning models. 

**Technologies Used**: 
- Sandman.MD (digital anesthesia documentation tool) 
- AI-driven data analytics suite 
- Predictive modeling tools 
- Smart alert functionality 

**Achievements**: 
- Successfully integrated Sandman.IC into the AI-driven data analytics suite
- Validated the system in ICU settings across Europe
- Validated the system in ICU settings across Europe
- Ensured compliance with GDPR for data anonymization
- Creation of a harmonised clinical dataset to be used in the project

**Impact**:
- Sandman.IC implemented at 13 hospitals across Europe

### Project 2: ECMO Reader: an open-source data acquisition and analysis system for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation devices

#### Description: 
ECMO Reader is an open-source Python program with a graphical user interface designed for managing and visualizing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) data in real-time. Developed specifically for Getinge ECMO devices used at Frankfurt University Hospital, it records and visualizes cyclical measurement data, such as blood temperature, pressure, and pump parameters, in real-time. The primary aim of ECMO Reader is to provide a tool for creating medical datasets and analyzing them to potentially enhance patient outcomes. By documenting treatment events and visualizing measurement data in real-time, the software assists medical staff in recognizing trends and potential complications, allowing for timely intervention.

**Key Features**: 
- User-friendly GUI
- Records and visualizes cyclical measurement data in real-time
- Allows documentation of custom treatment events (e.g., visitations, oxygenator changes, patient transports, complications)
- Enables the creation of medical datasets for analysis and potential improvement of patient outcomes
- Facilitates the development of machine learning models for real-time prediction of changes in patient condition
- Runs on a Raspberry Pi 4B with an integrated touchscreen and includes a lithium-ion battery for seamless operation
 
**Technologies Used**: 
- Python, Tkinter
- Raspberry Pi 4B with integrated touchscreen 
- Getinge ECMO devices (CardioHelp, Rotaflow I, Rotaflow II) 

**Impact**: 
- Provides medical staff with real-time insights into patient data, aiding in the early detection of complications
- Facilitates the development of machine learning models for predictive analytics
- Enhances patient care by enabling proactive intervention based on data trends

### Project 3: ECMO Dashboard

#### Description: 
ECMO Dashboard is a web-based visualization tool developed to display publicly available treatment data on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) utilization in Germany. The dashboard provides interactive visualizations, analyses, and predictions based on real-life data sourced from the Federal Statistical Office of Germany and quality reports of the “Gemeinsame Bundesauschuss” (GBA), fully anonymized upon delivery.  By visualizing historical data and providing forecasts, the dashboard aids healthcare professionals in understanding past trends and anticipating future demands.

**Key Features**: 
- Visualizes ECMO utilization data on an annual basis from 2006 to 2020 
- Displays the number of patients and their origins from 2005 to 2021
- Includes patient forecasts for the years 2022 and 2023
- Data parsed from quality reports consisting of XML files from individual hospitals in Germany
- Designed according to the user requirements of medical colleagues at Frankfurt University Hospital
- Fully anonymized data to ensure compliance with privacy regulations

**Technologies Used**: 
- Plotly Dash for web-based interactive visualization 
- Numpy and Pandas libraries for data merging and processing 
- Custom Python scripts for parsing XML files 

**Impact**: 
- Facilitates evidence-based decision-making in healthcare resource allocation. 
- Empowers medical professionals with tools to anticipate future demands and plan accordingly.

### Project 4: Evolution of Theranostic Applicator for Microwave Ablation Treatment

#### Description: 
The project aimed to develop further an MRI-compatible, dual-mode microwave applicator for diagnosis and thermal ablation treatment. This contributes to the advancement of theranostic applications in microwave ablation therapy, enhancing treatment precision and efficacy. The focus was on measuring and evaluating image artifacts caused by the applicator to ensure accurate placement during treatment. MRI images were acquired using Siemens Magnetom Aera 1.5 Tesla with various imaging sequences. 

**Key Responsibilities**: 
- Creation a MATLAB script to automatically measure applicator artefact in MRI images
- Measurement and evaluation of image artifacts caused by the microwave applicator 
- MRI image acquisition using Siemens Magnetom Aera 1.5 Tesla
- Statistical analysis of artefact measurements

**Technologies Used**: 
- Siemens Magnetom Aera 1.5 Tesla (MRI scanner) 
- MATLAB for script development 
- Microsoft Excel for statistical analysis
